Open Source for public contribution.

## Version

0.3.0 - stable and versioned using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Contributing


To contribute to the framework please make sure to checkout your branch based on `jb-development`!!
This is very important as it allows me to accept your pull request without having to publish a public version release.

Small, atomic Features, bugs, etc.
Use the `jb-development` branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted.
Please rebase as often as possible when working.
Work on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.

For Big Features or major API extensions/edits:
This is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch.
This allows you to work in isolation but it means I'll have to manually merge your work into the next public release.
Translation : it might take a bit longer so please be patient! (but sincerely thank you).
