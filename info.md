Sometimes, a new word is born to embody a culture, character, emotion or concept that had not yet been scribed in the English dictionary.

A single word can be an anthem for a powerful set of ideas or a moment in our human experience that we all know and love, hate, or find fascinating.

We, the authors and editors of Etymolution, swear to remain faithful to the Romantic & Germanic roots of the English language.
